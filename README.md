# menu

Have you ever gone to a highly rated restaurant, then had no clue what to order? Tons of well renowned restaurants serve a variety of dishes, and patrons go in and default to their favorite food items. Instead, check Menu. Menu aims to be a dish reviewing app that lets users rate and review specific meals off a restaurantâ€™s menu. Customers can pick a highly rated menu item when they go to a new place, or search for places that make their favorite food the best. Restaurants will also be able to put their own recommendations as well as provide more detailed information on their menus - should they choose to.
